# C-Programming
### Documentation of some of my beginner C projects (⌐■_■). (Emphasis on Data Structures & Algorithms)

#### 1.Recursion
###### FactFib console Application
* Implemented knowledge of recursive functions to create a factorial calculator.  
* Used recursive functions to print a number of fibonacci numbers (as per user input). 
* Created a makeshift login system by implementing use of strcmp() function from string.h header file. 

#### 2.Stack
###### DS-Stack Console Application
* Learnt about Stacks as a Data Structure in C.
* Mastered Last-In-First-Out principle of stacks.
* Implemented various stack functions e.g:<br>

| Function | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| push() | Adds a value to the top of the stack |
| pop() | Deletes the value at the top of the stack |
| peek() | Checks the value at the top of the stack |
| traverse() | Displays all elements in the stack (top to bottom) |
| isFull() | returns True (1) if the stack is full and False (0) if not |
| isEmpty() | returns True(1) if the stack is empty and False (0) if not |


#### 3.Linked list
###### linked-list(Single linked list) & doubly linked list
* Learnt about the use of *struct* in C to construct nodes.
* Learnt more about functional programming, dynamic programming and memory allocation.
* Created and implemented Linked list functions for:
  * Add node to beginning/end of list.
  * Display/Print linked list.
  * Count number of nodes in list.
  * Add node to specified position.
